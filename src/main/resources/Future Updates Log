BUG FIXES:

-Display List for Converted Files That aren't .mp4 does not Display Properly

HIGH PRIORITY:
-If file is in Artist - Filename format, ignore exiftool (Generates Artwork Properly?)
-YoutubeDL Support (Timestamps)
-Deprication & Removal of Obsolete Code
-YoutubeUplink -> Send Downloaded Video to Temp Folder, Not Output Folder
-Make All/FFMPEG Commands not have to copy the file to convert over to the temp folder
-Make a FLAC Converter (Ensure Can Get Picture)
-Make "StellarConverter" Interface or Superclass
-If a file doesn't have Stellar Conversion Date Stamp, Don't Include In Playlists

MODERATE PRIORITY:
-Transition to GUI
-Implement Control Groups as a way of controlling performance

LOW PRIORITY:
-Prompt for a picture on a direct conversion (OPUS Converter Tree Diagram), upstream chooses which one.
-Prompt for Deletion on ALL Conversions
-Make Space-Bridge CLI output nice and check logger output format.
-Platform Independent Performance Controls?
-Performance Profiles
